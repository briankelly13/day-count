I'm just playing around with Raku.

This script keeps track of the number of days since something. I use it to track when I last changed my contacts lenses or my furnace filter. It's a simple little thing, but I find it handy. Mostly though, I'm playing around with Raku.

This script isn't totally workable on its own yet. To start, you'll need to do a few things.

* create ~/.day/
* create plain text files in that folder that have dates in them
	- I'm using 8-digit dates. 27th June, 2021 is: 20210627
	- Nothing else on the line, newlines separating entries
	- Example:
20210627
20210815
20210930

Of course, this will all happen automatically at some point, but this is where we are today.
